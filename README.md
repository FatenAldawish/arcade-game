- The player can move left, right, up and down
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
- The player has three lives until the game is Over


## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
